## Udacity Project: Predict Bike Sharing Demand
Github repo containing the files for my personal take on the Bike Sharing Demand prediction using original data from Kaggle. This repo contains the code that can be visualize in both notebook and webpage format. Required data and final report of my personal findings is provided. An environment file is also provided in order to recreate the conda environment.

### File descriptions
note: Code and output was not reorganized to avoid reproducibility issues with paths (which can be easily fixed).

The 'project-template' notebook contains all the code for this project from data acquisition, model training, HPO and submission to kaggle competition. For easier reading you can always open the html version on any browser.
